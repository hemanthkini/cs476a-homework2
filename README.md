## Homework2

The overall synth was inspired by TRON, Daft Punk, and the JazzMutant Lemur. 

I created a noisy pluck synthesizer from an additive FM drum synth, put through a resonant LP filter, from Faust. The upper slider is used to control the frequency of the low-pass filter, and the lower slider controls the harmonic decay. I tried to make the sound very Daft-Punk-esque (i.e. sharp release and noisy filter - with a lot more time, I think it would be good, but this works well as a prototype, I think.) 

Design-wise, I wrote a custom slider look and button look to resemble the Lemur controller that Daft Punk uses - it is visually appealing and very easy to use. 

This instrument would work well on a touchscreen - unfortunately, I ended up having to record this on my MacBook, so the demo isnâ€™t as compelling as I would have hoped, but it is still interesting to me.
